<h1>easy lexer</h1>
<p>Simple and basic C lexer written in Python</p>
<p>To use it just run <b>python3 easyLexer.py</b></p>
<hr>
<p>I plan on expanding this lexer, eventually I want to create my own compiler.</p>
<p>This is <b>very</b> minimal, please see other repos for a more in depth view of a lexer.</p>
